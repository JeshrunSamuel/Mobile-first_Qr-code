## What I learned

In this project I learn to do resposive design by using "media queries"for CSS and responsive card design using CSS.Along the way I learned how to use git and github on my projects.

These are some snippets of the media queries

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 375px) {
  
    #wrapper {
        width: 100%;
    }
    .container {
        width: 100%;
        margin: 0;
    }
}
```

## Continued development

I want go further and deep on learning Responsive designs and CSS grid system in the near future.
